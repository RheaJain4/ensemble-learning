🧠 Obesity Risk Prediction Using Ensemble Learning
📘 Overview

This project predicts an individual’s obesity risk category using machine learning techniques. It explores the power of ensemble learning—combining multiple models to achieve better performance than any single model alone.

The notebook implements baseline models as well as advanced ensembles including Bagging, Boosting, Stacking, and Voting methods, and compares their performance using standard classification metrics.

📦 Dataset

The dataset includes lifestyle, demographic, and health-related attributes such as eating habits, physical activity levels, and body measurements.
(Include link here once you upload the dataset or host it.)

🎯 Objectives

Build a baseline ML model for obesity risk classification.

Implement multiple ensemble techniques to improve predictive accuracy and robustness.

Compare ensemble methods against the baseline using standard evaluation metrics.
